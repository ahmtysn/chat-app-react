## Introduction

This is a code repository,

We create a full Realtime Chat Application. We used React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end.

Send and receive messages using web sockets and Socket.io to make any real-time application.

Setup:

```
- run `npm i && npm start` for both client and server side to start the development server
```
